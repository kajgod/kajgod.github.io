href="https://www.val.town" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Val Town</a> <!-- -->for a few hours here and there over the past couple of days. Surprisingly, I find it quite enjoyable, and I&#x27;m not easily entertained by anything even remotely alike work. Plus it&#x27;s basically free (there&#x27;s a paid tier, but you can do almost anything for free).</p><h3>So, what exactly is it?</h3><p>Val Town is inspired by Twitter (don&#x27;t event THINK about X Town, Elon Musk!), but what you <em>tweet</em> are snippets of TypeScript (single functions or variables). You can make them private or public, and there&#x27;s a val-way of refferencing them in other <em>vals</em>. My nickname is kajgod, therefore if you want to include my function in your code - you just write @kajgod.nameOfTheFunction(). On the other hand, if I want to persist some data - all I need to do is create a <em>val</em> that consists of a single variable. Anything in that variable will be persistant.</p><p>Since the data I want to persist probably isn&#x27;t for public use, I can make that <em>val</em> private, and reference it inside of my functions as @me.myVar, instead od @kajgod.myVar. This way, if you reference my code, it will lookup YOUR variable myVar, not mine. Pretty, pretty cool!</p><aside>EDIT: Latest<!-- --> <a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-runtime-v3-my-mistakes-were-easy-the-solutions-simple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog post</a> <!-- -->on Val.Town mentions some downsides of this approach (neither of which I agree with :-)), so they&#x27;ll replace it with ES6 imports (at least they&#x27;ll appear like ES6 imports). Well, what can you do... it&#x27;s a developing platform. Changes are expected.</aside><h3>What can you do with it?</h3><p>The idea is that you write small chunks of code, and can easily string them together into larger projects. The best part is how easily you get a working backend with no need for AWS clicking, packaging, DevOps... It&#x27;s all handled for you.</p><p>Btw. did I mention how simple it is to create an account and start coding? It takes about 10 seconds... You just register with your Github account (maybe some others work, I don&#x27;t really remember, and I don&#x27;t care to check) and you&#x27;re ready to code!</p><p>Even better: they have a few nice tricks to make your life even simpler and they work like a charm.</p><p>For example, they extend console prototype with a simple email method which sends an email to your registered email account. There are a few more options (HTML email and some other stuff), but the simplest (and most useful) one is:</p><pre>console.email(&quot;Hey Kajgod,\n\rHere&#x27;s an e-mail to yourself.&quot;, &quot;Some subject&quot;);<!-- --> </pre><aside>EDIT: Amazingly, this too is mentioned in the<!-- --> <a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-runtime-v3-my-mistakes-were-easy-the-solutions-simple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blog post</a> <!-- -->as a bad idea, and will be replaced with more purist implementation. Again, i disagree, because I feel these changes will take away a bit of magic-coolness from Val Town and make it look more like Deno playground instead of a <em>social programming tool</em> they set out to build, and I thought was a cool idea.<!-- --> </aside><p>And that&#x27;s it!</p><p>Such a great tool to create prototypes or small project that don&#x27;t need to scale, including:</p><ul><li>Web pages</li><li>Web APIs</li><li>CRON jobs</li><li>Web crawlers capable of sending you emails</li><li>...</li></ul><h3>Some examples</h3><p>I built a few apps that are actually useful to me.</p><p>I coach a few high-level mathletes and there are some organizations in Zagreb, Croatia that help bringing up talented kids, but the tricky part is that they offer camps and education opportunities on the first-come-first-served basis. If you visit their websites often, you have a better chance of getting into those (I&#x27;m simplifying the process, but nevermind).<!-- --> </p><p>Enter the web crawlers:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.val.town/v/kajgod.fetchMnm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.mnm.hr</a></li><li><a href="https://www.val.town/v/kajgod.fetchZrs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.zrs.hr</a></li></ul><p>The two supersimple scripts above were already useful to me, and I wonder why I didn&#x27;t make them sooner. I haven&#x27;t set up a local server in my house yet, but there are other free options where you can run crone-fired lambdas, maybe even always-awake processes (maybe not? does fly.io keep the process up at all times on their free tier? probably not, that would be expensive for them). The thing is - Val.Town made it so easy and fun it didn&#x27;t feel like chore. I hate chores. Workday is practically a long stretch of chores for me, so I tend to procrastinate when off-work.</p><p>Making chores feel less like chores and more like fun is such a good selling point IMHO.</p><h3>How can I use it?</h3><p>Well, if you happen to be from Croatia, and you know young mathletes - you can just fork my vals and use them as they are :-)</p><p>Since that isn&#x27;t the case, you can drop a look at this wal (<a href="https://www.val.town/v/kajgod.persistantValues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@kajgod.persistantValues</a>), and create another one just like that one:</p><pre>let persistantValues = <!-- -->{}<!-- -->;</pre><p>...this creates a variable that will automagically become your permanent storage. Any variable created as a val (outside execution context of a function, which gets destroyed/GC-ed as soon the function gets off of the callstack, just like in &quot;normal&quot; JS) will preserve state permanently. The documentation tells us something about such variables only being able to keep data that is JSON-like because they get written on FS as stringified JSON or something like that, but that&#x27;s fine because that&#x27;s all we need anyway.</p><p>Then you crawl the site, find the info that&#x27;s the newest, and stash it in that variable. On every successive call, just check if the data you got was already sent, and that&#x27;s it.</p><p>Val will autosave with the function name, and if you&#x27;re new to Val Town, you may forget that a val must be a single variable or function. The editor will envelope your code in a IIFE automagically. This sort of attention to details is what impressed me the most. Running a <em>val</em> <!-- -->as a CRON job is also supersimple. Dropdown menu, and you&#x27;re all set up. You don&#x27;t even have to google the ever elusive CRON syntax, because you have a dropdown with options like run every hour, every 15 mins etc.</p><p>I have my worries about Val Towns future because the social aspect didn&#x27;t really catch up yet, and I have no idea for how long they have funding, but do try it, it can only help.</p></div></main><footer><nav><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/articles-archive">Archive</a></li></ul></nav></footer></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"slug":"val-town-is-pretty-cool"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[slug]","query":{"slug":"val-town-is-pretty-cool"},"buildId":"9AXB_6lRO7nhQvzH5K52i","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
